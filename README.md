# Automating-Emails-From-Spreadsheet
Using Google App Script, this script sends emails with the same template and inserts the corresponding data from the spreadsheet.

This project was inspired by having the need to send 50+ emails of containing sevice hour confirmations with a template and having monotonously enter data which can be time consuming.  Therefore, I decided to make a script that allows to send all of the emails at once.
